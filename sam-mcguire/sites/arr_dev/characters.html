			<p>Michael Bluth is the main character of Arrested Development. Michael is the straight man to his outlandish Bluth family, but he also has many peculiarities. 
			He likes being right so much that it pains him when he is incorrect. 
			He has trouble keeping his dating life normal, and although he prides himself on being a good parent he often misinterprets what his son is experiencing.
			Michael is the son of real estate mogul George Bluth. He takes over as President of The Bluth Company when his father is incarcerated for fraud. 
			He is the son of Lucille Bluth and is frequently called by her when she needs a favor. He is the father to George Michael Bluth whom he tries to help navigate through awkward adolescence. 
			He is the brother to Buster and G.O.B. both of whom Michael often has to clean up after. 
			His sister Lindsay, her husband Tobias, and their daughter Maeby move in with him after hitting financial woes of their own.</p>

			<p>Lindsay Bluth Funke, born Nellie, is the sister of Michael, G.O.B. and Buster Bluth, and the adopted and only daughter of Lucille and George Bluth. 
			As an act of rebellion, Lindsay married Tobias Funke with whom, and $130,000 in medical assistance, she had her daughter Maeby Funke. 
			Lindsay and Tobias have a rocky relationship, partially due to Tobias' ambiguous sexuality and Lindsay's flippant attitude. Lindsay is an extremely hands-off mother to Maeby, often forgetting she exists. 
			To fill her spare time, Lindsay enjoys shopping, frequenting upscale restaurants and bars, and hosting charity events.</p>

			<p>George Oscar Bluth Jr., better known as G.O.B., is the arrogant older brother to Michael Bluth and is a main character of Arrested Development.
			He is portrayed by Will Arnett and appears in 66 episodes of the series. 
			A social peacock, G.O.B. exudes a certain type of showmanship at all times, perhaps best illustrated by his favorite mode of transportation: his trusty Segway. 
			Once a highly respected magician and founder of The Alliance of Magicians, G.O.B. fell from grace when the TV news revealed the secret to his illusion.</p>

			He joins the Army on his mother's whim from which he repeatedly tries to escape. He lost his left hand to a seal attack when enjoying the ocean in defiance of his mother, Lucille Bluth for the first time.

			<p>Tobias Onyango Funke is the husband of Lindsay Bluth Funke and the father of Maeby Funke and is a main character of Arrested Development. 
			He is portrayed by David Cross and appears in 59 episodes of the series. He was a psychiatrist and therapist but lost his licenses after harming a man during CPR. 
			He has since been seeking work as an actor with little success. He aspired to be a member of the Blue Man Group for a while, but they rejected him.
			Lindsay married Tobias as a form of protest against her parents, but the two rarely have intimate moments. Although he repeatedly denies it, he is most likely homosexual. 
			He suffers from a rare psychological condition, making him a Never Nude. He has a strange pattern of speech that makes almost everything he says have a disturbingly sexual undertone. 
			He seems unaware of this.</p>
