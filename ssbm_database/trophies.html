      <h1>Trophies</h1>
      <p>Trophies are collectible items found throughout the game. While all 26
        playable characters have 3 trophies, each earned from completing a
        Regular Match 1P mode, trophies may also represent a wide variety of
        characters, objects, and locations from Nintendo's history.</p>

      <p>Trophies can be found while playing a Regular Match 1P mode. In
        Classic Mode, trophies can be obtained during the "Snag the Trophies"
        minigame. In Adventure Mode, trophies have a chance of spawning on an
        adventure stage. In All-Star Mode, trophies can appear in the rest
        area in between matches.</p>

      <h3>Lottery</h3>

        Lottery." class="right" width=250px />
      <p>As time is spent playing the game, players will earn coins that can be
        used in the Lottery. When coins are spent here, players have a chance
        at obtaining a new trophy. As more trophies are earned, the chance of
        winning a new one decreases. Not all trophies can be earned from the
        Lottery; many require specific tasks to be completed.</p>
